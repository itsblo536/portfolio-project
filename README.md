# Portfolio Project

A project done after going through a self-guided Python and Django course. This project utilizes Python, Django, Bootstrap, and Postgres.

# Description
For this project, I used Python, Django, Boostrap, and Postgres to build a personal website that displays an introduction about 
myself, my past projects, as well as additional links to my resume, email, and github. There is also an additional feature with blogs that I have
made, as I was trying to find a new hobby of blogging some of my past experiences that I could look back on.

# Learning Outcomes
This project was the first big project I had built and the course really helped guide me through it. I wasn't very familiar with styling at the time, so
I used a template from bootstrap to build the layout of my website. The main point of this project was to not only have a personal website I could display,
but also learn how web development works: I learned how to integrate a backend system using Postgres and also learned how Django is used in web development.
